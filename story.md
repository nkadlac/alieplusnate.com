This site is dedicated to our wedding, happening on August 19, 2017. If you found this page, you are one lucky S.O.B.

Alie was born and raised in Mequon, WI, a northern suburb of Milwaukee. After graduating high school, she moved to Minneapolis to attend the University of Minnesota for both undergraduate and graduate school. She currently practices social work at HIP Housing, a nonprofit organization in San Mateo.

Nate was also a suburban boy, spending his first 20 years in Brooklyn Park, MN.

Like the typical modern couple, we met on the internet in the summer of 2012. The first time Nate came over to Alie's house in South Minneapolis, he was greeted by three big dogs and one mean kitty. How he was ever able to look past all that furry baggage will always be a mystery. I guess that's true love!

After dating for 2.5 years in Minneapolis, we picked up our stuff (and only 1 of the 3 dogs) and moved to San Francisco where we've been ever since.  On September 8 of 2016, while visiting Italy with the Sobczaks and celebrating Robert and Marleen's 40th wedding anniversary, Nate proposed on a beach in the Mediterranean.
