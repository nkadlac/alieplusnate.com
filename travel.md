Airports: Both San Francisco (SFO) and Oakland (OAK) airports are options for flying into the Bay Area. From our house in Haight-Ashbury, it's about equal driving distance to both. Pick whichever is cheapest and most convenient for you!

From the airport:

* Uber https://get.uber.com/sign-up/?exp=home_signup_form 
-Uber originated in San Francisco (go figure). As a result, it's pretty dang hard to hail a cab in the city these days. Uber and Lyft are the prefered modes of transportation - and the cheapest! If you don't already use Uber, make sure you download the app on  your phone and set up your account before you get here. San Francisco also has UberPool (you'll be matched with another rider going in your same general direction), which is the cheapest option of them all. We use UberPool all the time and love it. It'll save you some money on a otherwise expensive cab ride from the airport into the city. UberPool fares range from $17-25ish. Want more info on how to use Uber? Call or email us!
* Lyft https://www.lyft.com/
-See above. Same thing, different company. Instead of UberPool, these guys call the same concept Lyft Line. 

* BART/MUNI https://www.bart.gov/ & https://www.sfmta.com/
-The Bay Area's public transportaion sytstems. Slowest but cheapest way to get from the airport to the city. Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) services the *whole* Bay Area, including the Peninsula, San Francisco, Oakland and East Bay. San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (MUNI) only serives the City of San Francisco. In order to get from the airport to the city, you'll need to take a combination of trains on buses through these two systems. Confused? You're not alone. Shoot us an email if you want more detailed directions!

* Super Shuttle http://www.supershuttle.com/
-This is a van shuttle service that you can schedule ahead of time. Great option if you want to secure you're ride before you arrive at the airport. When you book, you enter the name or address of where you are staying, so the driver already will have your information. Prices can range from $17-100, depending on how fancy you want to get.

* Taxi
-Most expensive but simplest option if you don't want to mess around with any of the above services. You'll see signed at the airport direct you to taxi pick up locations. A ride from the airport to downtown San Francisco is about $50. If you're staying at a hotel downtown, you will in fact be able to hail a cab. If you stay at an Airbnb in more residential parts of the city, you probably won't be able to find one. *Enter Uber*

Side note: Of course, renting a car is also an option. However, if your hotel or Airbnb does not have parking provided, you may want to reconsider renting a car. PARKING IN SAN FRANCISCO IS A NIGHTMARE. You could be circling for 30 minutes before finding a spot on the street. Parking on steep hills can also be challenging if you're not already used to it. True Story: Alie did not drive for the first two weeks of living in San Francisco because she was so intimidated by the hills. It took her another 2 months of adjusting before she could drive without sweaty palms. Nate had no problem with any of this. Choose your own adventure!
