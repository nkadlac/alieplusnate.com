## Friday:

**Welcome Party**
We know a lot of you are taking the time and money to travel across the country to celebrate our wedding. And that is *everything* to us. We want to maximize our time with each and everyone of you, so we're going to do an open-house style welcome reception. Come say hi and drink a beer. More details coming soon.

## Saturday:

**The Big Day **This is where all your dreams come true. Or, at least ours. We can't make any promises about yours.

## Sunday:

**Hangover Brunch**
Again, we are all about making the most of this weekend! Why stop the fun after Saturday night?! Before you head back home, come say bye, eat a donut and drink a mimosa. More details coming soon.
