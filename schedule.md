## Friday, August 18

**Welcome Party**: We know a lot of you are taking the time and money to travel across the country to celebrate our wedding. And that is *everything* to us. We want to maximize our time with each and everyone of you, so we're going to do an open-house style welcome reception. Come say hi and drink a beer. More details coming soon.

## Saturday, August 19

**The Big Day**: This is where all your dreams come true. Or, at least ours. We can't make any promises about yours.
